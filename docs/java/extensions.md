# Java Extensions for VS Code

Visual Studio Code provides many features as an editor. In addition to that, you can install some high quality extensions to add features to VS Code for Java development.

> **Tip:** To see how to install and manage your extensions, please refer to the [extension documentation](/docs/editor/extension-gallery.md).

## Recommended extensions

To help set up Java on VS Code, there is a [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) which contains two popular extensions:

1. [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)
2. [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)

There's also a [Java Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test), which runs JUnit tests for your Java code.

In case you're working on Spring Boot, there's also a [Spring Boot Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack) developed by Pivotal.

## Recommended extensions for cloud (Azure) development

Along with the language support, if you are deploying your applications to the cloud, especially Azure, there is a [Azure Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-azureextensionpack) which contains extensions for popular Azure Services:

### App Services (Websites)

* The [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice) extension lets you quickly browse, create, manage, and deploy Azure App Service websites.

### Functions (serverless computing)

* The [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension lets you quickly browse, create, manage, deploy, and even debug Azure functions locally.

### Micro-Services

* The [Docker Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker) extension makes it easy to develop and deploy containerized micro-service based applications using Docker containers. Use [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/overview) to create a CI/CD pipeline to build your containerized applications, deploy them to the [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/container-registry/), run web sites directly in [Azure App Services](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/app-service/), and run multi-container systems at scale using the [Azure Container Service](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/container-service/).

### Storage

* The [Azure Data Lake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usqlextpublisher.usql-vscode-ext) make it easy to develop U-SQL projects against [Azure Data Lake](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/data-lake-store/)! This extension provides a cross-platform, light-weight, keyboard-focused authoring experience for U-SQL while maintaining a full set of development functions.

### Databases

* The [Azure CosmosDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb) extension lets you create, manage, and query CosmosDB accounts, including support for Mongo, Graphs, Tables, and DocumentDB databases.

* The [Microsoft SQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) extension provides support for developing [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com//sql-server/sql-server-2016), [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/sql-database/) and [SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/sql-data-warehouse/) with a rich set of functionalities. For example, create and manage connection profiles and most recently used connections. Write T-SQL script with IntelliSense, snippets, syntax colorizations, error validations and GO batch separator. Execute scripts, view the results in a document, and save results to json or csv file format and view in the editor.

### Team development

* The [Visual Studio Team Services](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.team) extension makes it easy to connect to your Team Services and Team Foundation Servers, allowing you to easily monitory builds, pull requests, and work items for your TFVC or Git source repositories.

### Internet of Things

* The [Azure IoT Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-toolkit) for VS Code makes it easy to develop and connect your [IoT applications to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com//azure/index#pivot=services&panel=iot). With this extension, you can interact with Azure IoT Hub, manage devices connected to Azure IoT Hub, and develop with code snippets for Azure IoT Hub.

### General tools

* The [Azure Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradygaster.azuretoolsforvscode) adds commands to the Command Palette (F1) that make it easy to create and access Azure resources directly from VS Code. For example, you can create App Service Web Apps and Functions, Storage accounts, and browse to any number of resources in the Azure Portal.

* The [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) provide a rich editing experience for Azure Resource Manager deployment templates and template language expressions. For example, IntelliSense for TLE function names, parameter references, signature help, GoTo Definition, Peek Definitions, and Find All References (Shift+F12) as well as Errors and Warnings, making it quick and easy to author ARM templates in VS Code.

* The [Azure CLI Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azurecli) provide an enhanced editing experience when authoring Azure CLI 2.0 commands, with full completions (IntelliSense), the ability to invoke one or more commands in the terminal, and the ability to easily view and format results as a separate JSON document.

* The [Azure Application Insights](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioOnlineApplicationInsights.application-insights) extension brings information from your production services right into the editor (via Code Lenses), helping you to find and fix issues even faster.
